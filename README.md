Digital Garden Documentation

This Digital Garden was created to fill up my portfolio and to learn more about Recoil and get more familiar with Bootstrap, NodeJS (with Express) and MySQL. 

Recoil is a new state management library designed exclusively for React. For now it's still experimental but the functionality is there. Redux is widely known and used but I expect that Recoil will replace Redux on a lot of projects going forward. Mainly because it integrates so well with React and it requires very little boilerplate code. The learning curve is also much lower with Recoil opposed to Redux. No connect	function. No mapStateToProps function. Just import the atom en use it like you would any hook.
